Data gathered of a static cuboid on objects in ambient or total darkness. Only 3 objects were included in the paper for brevity, but all of these tested objects had good resulting maps. 

fun fact: 
the bump on both of the screwdrivers was actually a pin sticing up, not a glitch with the algorithm!
